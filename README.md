# Library-Management-System
Prim’s Algorithm – Library Shelf Connection Visualizer

An interactive web-based project that demonstrates **Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithm using a library shelf connection analogy.

This project allows users to:

* Add shelves (nodes) on a canvas
* Assign weights between shelves
* Visualize all edges
* Run Prim’s algorithm step-by-step
* See MST edges, current considered edges, and final MST cost
* Animate the algorithm
* Save the canvas as an image

────────────────────────────────────────

🚀 **Features**

**Interactive Canvas**
Click anywhere on the canvas to place shelves (nodes) dynamically.

**Manual or Random Graph Support**

* Auto-generate shelves
* Add your own nodes manually
* Enter custom weights

**Prim’s MST Algorithm Visualization**

* Shows all edges clearly
* Highlights selected MST edges
* Shows the currently considered edge
* Displays `key[]`, `parent[]`, and `inMST[]` states
* Calculates total MST cost

**Step-by-Step Animation**

* Build steps (precomputes algorithm flow)
* Move to next step
* Auto-play with animation
* Adjustable speed slider for smooth control

**Save Output as PNG**
Export the final canvas drawing as an image.

────────────────────────────────────────

📁 **Project Structure**
This project is a **single HTML file** containing:

* Structured HTML layout
* CSS (modern UI styling with optional light/dark theme)
* JavaScript logic for:

  * Canvas drawing
  * Graph generation
  * MST computation
  * Animation logic
